Return only valid JSON in the following format:
{
  "overallSummary": "A concise, 5â€“7 sentence summary capturing the overall tone and major themes of the feedback. Include both positive and negative sentiments, highlighting general user impressions, common frustrations, and frequently requested improvements. Focus on a balanced, professional tone that reflects the broader user experience without getting lost in overly specific details (e.g. 'Users generally appreciate the intuitive design but often mention performance issues as a pain point')."
  "topPraise": "The most commonly praised aspect, ideally related to a specific feature, design choice, or user experience element (e.g. 'Users love the clean interface', 'The onboarding flow is intuitive', 'The dark mode is highly appreciated').",
  "topPain": "The most common complaint or pain point, ideally related to a specific feature, design choice, or user experience element (e.g. 'Users find the search function slow', 'The app crashes on older devices', 'Navigation is confusing').",
  "topIntensity": "The strongest or most emotional opinion, ideally related to a specific feature, design choice, or user experience element (e.g. 'Users are frustrated with slow loading times', 'Users feel strongly about the lack of customization options').",
  "topRequestedFeature": "The most commonly requested specific feature or improvement, ideally a concrete product addition (e.g. 'Add dark mode', 'Support for offline use').",
  "praisePoints": [
    {
      "text": "Summarized insight (e.g. 'Users love the minimal design')",
      "source": "A real quoted Reddit comment from the input that best illustrates this praise."
    }
  ],
  "painPoints": [
    {
      "text": "Summarized issue (e.g. 'Shipping delays are a common frustration')",
      "source": "A real quoted Reddit comment from the input that best illustrates this pain point."
    }
  ],
  "requestedFeatures": [
    {
      "text": "A specific feature request that clearly describes a desired addition or enhancement (e.g. 'Add a dark mode', 'Support for offline use', 'Customizable notifications')",
      "source": "A real quoted Reddit comment from the input that best illustrates this specific feature request."

  ]
}

Instructions:
- Include 3 to 5 items for each section (or fewer if there aren't enough unique insights).
- Each text must summarize a unique insight or feedback theme. Do not repeat the same insight across multiple items.
- Focus on specific features, designs, or parts of the user experience (e.g. 'Users love the minimal design', 'Navigation is confusing', 'Users want a dark mode'). Avoid vague generalizations like 'Good quality' or 'Bad experience'.
- Requested features should be specific, actionable product additions or enhancements (e.g. 'Add dark mode', 'Support offline mode', 'Customizable notifications'). Avoid vague, general improvements like 'Better quality' or 'Fix performance'.
- Each source must be a direct, unedited quote from the input text. Do not paraphrase, truncate, reword, or synthesize.
- Do not invent or simulate quotes. Use only full, original comments.
- Do not include typographic quotation marks in the comment text.
- Return only a valid JSON object. No markdown, no code fences, no extra text, no commentary, no formatting.
